**UPDATE:** I have ported this to Javascript. Visit <a href='http://www.tailjs.com'>tailjs.com</a> on Google Chrome to try it out!

Ability to tail small and big files for updates using PHP and AJAX. Includes the ability to grep results for a specific keyword.

  * Fully documented
  * Fully customizable
  * Updates the page with new information without a page refresh
  * Change GREP keyword / invert on the fly without a page refresh
  * Uses JQuery / JQueryUI libraries
  * Simple to use UI
  * Automatic scrolling when required (if a user scrolls up, the automatic scroll is disabled until the user scrolls to the bottom again)
